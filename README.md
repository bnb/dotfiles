# dotfiles

this is a simple home for my dotfiles. Zero automation in it, just the source for each dotfile respectively and an `install.md` file that surfaces the tools needed for the envirionment to be set up successfully.

## Contents

  * [./configs/zsh](./configs/zsh): the majority of the configuration files in this repo, focused on setting up my zsh environment. There's a pretty good [README.md](./configs/zsh/README.md) in that redirectory that gives a lot more context.
  * [.gitconfig](./.gitconfig): my basic .gitconfig.
  * [.npmrc](./.npmrc): my basic .npmrc.
  * [install.md](./install.md): a list of things that should probably be installed.
